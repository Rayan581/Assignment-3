Here's a `README.md` file for the code, assuming that the code is similar to the one described in our previous message for finding the players with the most games played using a BST.

# Player Management System

This project implements a `Player` management system using a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The main BST is organized by `playerId` and provides basic functionalities for adding and managing players. Additionally, the code includes an auxiliary BST structure that organizes players based on the number of `gamesPlayed`, allowing for quick retrieval of players with the most games played.

## Features

- **Primary BST**: Stores player data in a tree sorted by `playerId`.
- **Auxiliary BST**: An additional tree is constructed based on `gamesPlayed` to enable finding players with the highest number of games.
- **Top Players Retrieval**: Uses a reverse in-order traversal to retrieve and display the top N players with the most games played.

## Structure

- **`Player` Class**: Manages player data, including insertion into the main BST and retrieval based on `gamesPlayed`.
  - **`Node` Struct**: Represents a player node with attributes for `playerId`, `name`, and `gamesPlayed`.
  - **`GamesPlayedNode` Struct**: An auxiliary node storing a pointer to the original `Player` node, sorted by `gamesPlayed`.
- **Functions**:
  - **`insert`**: Inserts a new player into the main BST.
  - **`showTopPlayers`**: Builds the auxiliary BST sorted by `gamesPlayed` and prints the top N players.
  - **`displayNLayers`**: Performs the Breadth First Traversal and shows N layers of the tree.

## Code Example

Here is a basic example of how to use the `Player` class to add players and display the top N players by `gamesPlayed`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Player player;

    load_player(player); // Load the player
    player.print(); // Print the player
    player.showTopPlayers(5); // Show top 5 players

    return 0;
}
```

## Usage

1. Compile the code with your preferred C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ AI_B_A3_i230018.cpp -o main
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

3. The output will display all the players' information and displays top 5 players
